## Safe Versions

Currently, no version are released, and so vulnerabilities are not a matter for the moment.

When vulnerabilities will be found and hopefully solved, "safe" versions wil be listed in this table.

| Version | Safe               | Reason                              |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
|         |                    |                                     |
