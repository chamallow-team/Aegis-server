An open-source, real time, strategy-focused, multiplayer game !


## Description
This game, at the time being, has no release version, and is more at the state of an idea than an actual game.

> `But everything have to start somewhere right ?`

Right ! That why you are here reading this readme. We may be only at the start of this *huge* project, but we have good hopes for it.

> `So what's your plans ?`

We are actively developing the game, trying our best to get the whole picture. You can check the advancement on the branches/commits, but also [here](#advancement).

We are also trying to build a little community around our project, to have an external view that will help us make the bests choices for you, the player, ... and maybe getting some help ?

The profit of the open source state of Aegis, is that anyone can help, even with no rust knowledge ! *So if you're interested in helping, contact us on [discord](#community) ;)*

> `Open source ? What does this mean ?`

That just mean that it's the property of it's community ! It's meaned to be a free game, that follows it's community will, and will never become a souless p2w game.
