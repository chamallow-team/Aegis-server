# CSP example
This directory contains an example of the CSP protocols used by aegis.

It serves as a reference on how to implement this protocol.

To *start* the example you need [luvit](https://luvit.io) as a lua runtime. This is an implementation of the CSP protocol on a tchat server with clients

This server-client example requires you to start the [server](./server.lua) first, then start on another terminal a [client](./client.lua). you can start as many client as you wish at the same time! fell free to test how you want
